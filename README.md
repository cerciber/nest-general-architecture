  <summary><b>Demo</b></summary>

You can try out a demo of the API [here](<- link ->).

To access the demo, use `/auth/login` with the following credentials:
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "ABC#abc#123"
}
```
```json
{
  "username": "client_1",
  "password": "ABC#abc#123"
}
```

You can use the Swagger Bearer authentication by clicking `Authorize` to enter the token generated from the `/auth/login` endpoint. Once you have authenticated with the token, you can automatically test all endpoints that the user has access to.

## Project Setup

<details>
  <summary>See the steps to configure and run the project</summary>
<br>

1. **Install Node.js, Git, and Npm:**

    Download and install **Node.js** (preferably version 22 to ensure compatibility) from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en). Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```

    Download and install **Git** from the official website: [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

    **Npm** is installed automatically with Node.js. Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    npm --version
    ```

2. **Clone the project and switch to the `develop` branch:**

    Run the following commands to clone the repository and checkout the `develop` branch:

    ```bash
    git clone https://https://github.com/cerciber/nest-general-architecture.git
    cd nest-general-architecture
    git checkout develop
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    Run the following command to install all project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create configuration file:**

    Create a file named `.env.development` in the root of the project with the following content:

    ```bash
    # PORT: Port number on which the application will listen for incoming requests
    PORT=
    # MONGO_URI: Connection string for MongoDB. Includes the database server address, port, and authentication details if required.
    MONGO_URI=
    # JWT_SECRET_KEY: Key used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Ensure this key is strong, unique, and kept confidential.
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=
    ```

5. **Create sample data (Only if you want to use your own database):**

    If you need reset database and set sample data, you can easily do so by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run db:reset
    ```

6. **Install VSC extensions (Optional for Visual Studio Code) :**

    You can install the required VS Code extensions by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
    code --install-extension rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint
    ```

    Alternatively, you can install these extensions `Prettier ESlint` and `ESlint` manually from the VS Code marketplace.

    To ensure that the configurations are applied correctly, restart Visual Studio Code.
<br>

7. **Run the project in development mode:**

    Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the project in development mode:

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    This will start the project with the development configuration. 
    
    You can view the documentation at `http://localhost:<PORT>/docs`, where `<PORT>` is the port specified in your `.env.development` file.

  <summary>Git Branching Strategy</summary>
  <br>

  The Git branching strategy ensures a structured and predictable workflow, facilitating continuous integration and easy management of releases and fixes. Below are the main branches and their specific purposes in the project:

  #### `main`
  Contains stable, production-ready code. All final releases are made from this branch.

  #### `develop`
  Integration branch for ongoing development. All new features and improvements are merged here before being released.

  #### `deploy`
  Used to prepare and deploy code to staging or production environments. Derived from `develop` or `main`.

  #### `fix/issue-xxxx`
  Dedicated branch for urgent bug fixes. Based on `main`, itâ€™s used to resolve critical issues that need immediate attention.

  #### `feature/issue-xxxx`
  Individual branches for developing new features or resolving specific issues, derived from `develop`. Named according to the related issue number (`issue-xxxx`).

<details>
  <summary>Conventional Commits</summary>
  <br>

  Use this format for commit messages:

  #### **Type**
  - **`feat`**: New feature
  - **`fix`**: Bug fix
  - **`docs`**: Documentation update
  - **`style`**: Code formatting
  - **`refactor`**: Code change without adding features or fixing bugs
  - **`test`**: Adding or updating tests
  - **`chore`**: Maintenance tasks

  #### **Scope**
  - Optional: Identifies the part of the code affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`).

  #### **Content**
  - Brief, imperative summary of the change.

  #### Examples

  - **Feature**: `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle`
  - **Bug Fix**: `fix(api): handle null values`
  - **Docs**: `docs(readme): update setup guide`
